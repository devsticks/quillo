# quillo
Quillo is a second-hand textbook marketplace, founded in 2018 by myself, Tamir Shklaz (@TamirShklaz), Senyo Simpson (@senyosimpson) and Thomas Tumiel (@ttumiel). What started as a summer vacation project has grown into an award-winning startup, serving thousands of students.
Quillo has since become a pure web app and development continues under the able leadership of Tamir.
